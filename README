Manual:

Build and Install
-----------------
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

  This will build and install 'fortune2' to /usr/local/bin and fortune2.db to
  /usr/local/share/fortune2.

  To uninstall:
  $ sudo make uninstall

fortune2 uses a sqlite3 database to store and retrieve fortune text strings.

Set the FORTUNE2FILE enironment variable to override the fortune2 db file.
Ex: $ export FORTUNE2FILE=~/my_fortune.db

By default, fortunes will be read from /usr/local/share/fortune2/fortune2.db


Display fortune
---------------
Get a random fortune:
  $ fortune2 

Get a random fortune from any of the jars: 'computers', 'news', 'perl':
  $ fortune2 computers news perl

Get a random fortune, displaying jar name (-c):
  $ fortune2 -c
  $ fortune2 -c computers news perl

Get a random fortune, consider all jars to be of equal size (-e) in terms of
probability:
 $ fortune2 -e
 $ fortune2 -e computers news perl
 
Display the list of jars to be searched, but don't display the fortune (-f):
  $ fortune2 -f
  $ fortune2 -f computers news perl

Display db file and complete list of jars:
  $ fortune2 info


Web API
-------
Start the web service:
  $ fortune2 serve
  $ fortune2 serve 8001

Optionally specify a port number (Ex. 8001) to start the web service.

To view sample web api requests, start the web service and browse to:
  http://localhost:8000/help/


Fortune2 Website
----------------
Start the web service and browse to http://localhost:8000/ to access a
webpage where you can display random fortunes.


Ingest fortunes
---------------
  $ fortune2 ingest fortunes/computers
  $ fortune2 ingest fortunes/cookie

This will add all fortunes from the 'computers' and 'cookie' text files
into the fortune2 database. Input files must be in the cookie jar format
in which fortunes are delimited by a single line containing "%".

The fortune jar name will be taken from the filename (Ex. 'computers',
'cookie').

On installation, all fortunes located in the fortunes/ directory will be
available. You can also run 'sudo make install_fortunes' separately.


Delete fortunes
---------------
  $ fortune2 delete computers cookie

This will delete all fortunes belonging in the jars 'computers' and 'cookie'. 


Search fortunes
---------------
  $ fortune2 search "bill gates" computers news
  $ fortune2 -i search "microsoft" computers
  $ fortune2 -i search "fortune"

This returns all fortunes from 'computers' and 'news' jars containing
"bill gates" case sensitive. Use the "-i" switch for case insensitive search.
If list of jars is not specified, all the jars will be searched.


Developer's Note:
fortune is one of my favorite Unix programs (along with 'cal'). To me, it's a
source of insight, humor, and inspiration. I added it to my .bashrc file to
get a new fun quote every time I start a new prompt. This is my attempt to
provide a modern makeover to it.

fortune2 can be used in the console as a replacement for the original fortune,
or as webservice backend for web apps.
